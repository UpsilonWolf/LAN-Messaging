## 📘 Description

LAN Messaging enables instant communication between two devices on the same LAN (Local Area Network).  
The software is written entirely in **Python 3**, leveraging several built-in modules to ensure smooth functionality and a simple graphical interface.

**Main modules used:**
- `Tkinter` — for the graphical interface  
- `Socket` — for the network connection between machines  
- `Functools` — for callback and function management  
- `Colorsys` — for color conversions  
- `Random` — for random color or theme generation  

All of these modules are included natively with Python 3 — **no external installation is required**.
